# Description
Libft is an introductory project from the 42 school that involves creating a static C library containing custom implementations of standard library (libc) functions and additional useful utilities.

The primary goal is to gain a deep understanding of fundamental C functions by rebuilding them from scratch, replicating their behavior as defined in the manual pages.
This library becomes a foundational toolkit for subsequent projects, where the use of the standard libc is often restricted.

# Instructions
To compile the Libft library, use the make command in the project directory. This will execute the rules defined in the Makefile to compile the source files and create a static library.

Key Commands:
make: Compiles the main library, producing libft.a.
make clean: Removes all object files (.o).
make fclean: Removes the libft.a library and all object files.
make re: Rebuilds the library from scratch (runs fclean then all).
# Resources
Man: The primary source for understanding the exact behavior of functions.
YouTube Tutorials: Used to better understand new and complex topics, such as memory management and linked lists, through visual explanations.
Reddit and Other Theoretical Websites: Valuable online platforms for seeking theoretical knowledge, asking specific questions, and finding solutions to challenging problems.
AI Assistance: Used to ask specific questions when neither peers nor online searches provided answers, helping to resolve programming issues that were otherwise difficult to solve.
